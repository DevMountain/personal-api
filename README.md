Personal API
============
<!--Code changes to form  a new branch-->
##Objective
Utilize Node.js and Express to create a simple REST API with your own data. You'll be building these endpoints by using `req.params`, `req.body`, and `req.query`. 

#### Step 1: Build your server's core - installation and server.js file.
* Create a file named `index.js`
* Run the `npm init -y` command to create our `package.json`.
* Now install your dependencies. We will be using Express and body-parser. Note that you can install multiple dependencies at once with npm: `npm install express body-parser cors --save`.
* Require Express, body-parser and cors in your `index.js`.
* Initialize your express app by invoking express and saving it to a variable named app.
* Use body-parser's json method in an `app.use()` method.
* Use `cors(`) in an `app.use()` method.

#### Step 1.5: Create a new file to store your user data.
In this step, you'll need to create a file called `user.js` to store your user object which will hold your personal data. You can access the contents of this file throughout your application by exporting with `module.exports`. Your `user` object should be in the format below. Feel free to add additional entries, but this is the bare minimum. Replace the null values with your own values.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  name: null,
  location: null,
  occupations: [],
  hobbies: [
    {
      name: null,
      type: null
    },
    {
      name: null,
      type: null
    },
    {
      name: null,
      type: null
    }
  ],
  family: [
    {
      name: null,
      relation: null,
      gender: null
    },
    {
      name: null,
      relation: null,
      gender: null
    },{
      name: null,
      relation: null,
      gender: null
    }
  ],
  restaurants: [
    {
      name: null,
      type: null,
      rating: null
    },
    {
      name: null,
      type: null,
      rating: null
    },
    {
      name: null,
      type: null,
      rating: null
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Step 2: Creating controllers
Create a folder named `controllers`. In controllers, add a file named `main_ctrl.js`.
Make sure to use `module.exports` so that we can access this controller from our `index.js` file.

Your `main_ctrl.js` will also need to access the contents of `user.js`, so you can view/manipulate your data. You can gain access to `user.js` by using `require` inside of your controller like so:

```javascript
var user = require('../user.js');
```


We now need to require the `main_ctrl.js` in our `index.js` like so:

```javascript
var main_ctrl = require('./controllers/main_ctrl.js');
```

#### Step 3: Build read-only endpoints
* Make sure your endpoints are below your top-level middleware.
* These endpoints will return data (see below)
* These endpoints should only be accessible with a GET request (read-only)
* These endpoints will call functions from your controller rather than having them declared inside of the endpoint. i.e `app.get('/name', main_ctrl.getName)` rather than `app.get('/name', function(req, res) { /*...*/});`

###### `GET /name`
- returns: Your name (e.g. Joe Sandwiches) in a JSON object:
`{ "name": "Donald Duck" }`

###### `GET /location`
- returns: Your location (e.g. Seattle, WA) in a JSON object:
`{ "location": "Timbuktu" }`

###### `GET /occupations`
- returns: Your past occupations as an array in a JSON object:
`{ "occupations": ["Thwarting Buggs Bunny", "Tomfoolery"] }`

###### `GET /occupations/latest`
- returns: The last/current job you have/had. The occupations will be stored in an array, but this method returns the last item of the array in a JSON reponse:
`{ "latestOccupation": "Tomfoolery" }`. (Hint: this is just basic Javascript to access the last value of an array - checkout .slice on MDN)

###### `GET /hobbies`
- returns: Your hobbies (e.g. Fishing, Swimming, etc.) as an array of objects in a JSON object:
```javascript
{ hobbies: [{
    "name": "Watching cartoons",
    "type": "current"
    },
    {
    "name": "Quacking",
    "type": "past"
    }
    ]
}
```

###### `GET /hobbies/:type`
- returns: Any hobbies that match the type property specified in the request parameter. (Hint: checkout the .filter method and the 2nd example of it [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff679973(v=vs.94).aspx))

###### `GET /family`
- returns: Your family members, as an array of objects in a JSON object.

- Allow for a 'relation' query to retrieve all family members that match a given relation.

###### `GET /family/:gender`
- returns: All family members of the specified gender (Hint: see the hint on the `/hobbies/:type` endpoint)

###### `GET /restaurants`
- returns: Your favorite restaurants, as an array of objects in a JSON object.

- Allow for a 'rating' query to retrieve all restaurants with a rating greater than or equal to 2. (Hint: go [here](https://support.sparkpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/202836800-Resource-Query-Filtering-Syntax) to see how to use greater than or equal to - see the Comparison Operators section.)

###### `GET /restaurants/:name`
- returns: Your favorite restaurant matching the supplied name parameter. (Hint: to use parameters - or queries - that are multiple words, use `+`: ex. `/restaurants/taco+bell`)


#### Step 4: Add ordering to your API
For the occupations endpoint with the get method that we just wrote, let's have a way for the client to get a specific ordering, alphabetized or reverse alphabetized.
* Make it so when the client requests occupations with a order query parameter, return an alphabetized list for the query `order=desc` and a reverse alphabetized list for the query `order=asc` (if your occupations endpoints are arrays of strings, you can simply use the Javascript `.sort()` and `.reverse()` methods of an array to do your sorting).
* This endpoint needs to work with or without an order query. So you will need to use an if statement (or a switch statement) to check the value/existence of `req.query.order`. 

#### Step 5: Make writable endpoints
Now you're going to make some endpoints that can be added to or modified by `POST` or `PUT` requests. Make sure that in addition to sending the new/updated information, you also modify your user object so that future `GET` requests will reflect your changes.

###### `PUT /name`
- Changes your name

###### `PUT /location`
- Updates your current location.

###### `POST /hobbies`
- Adds to your list of hobbies.

###### `POST /occupations`
- Adds to your list of occupations.

###### `POST /family`
- Adds to your list of family members.

###### `POST /restaurants`
- Adds to your list of restaurants.

#### Step 6: Create skills endpoint
This endpoint is going to be a bit more complicated than those you've made previously. For skills, we need to store a more complicated data structure. Here's how your skill could be structured:

```javascript
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Javascript",
  "experience": "Intermediate"
}
```

* Create a file called `skills.js` and populate it with an array of skills objects like the example above. This file will be similar in nature to your `user.js` file and as such should utilize `module.exports` and be required in the necessary controller files. 
* Create the endpoints:

###### `GET /skills`
- Retrieve the list of skills

- Also, allow an 'experience' query parameter so that someone can retrieve a list of skills that match a certain level of experience, like so:

`GET /skills?experience=Intermediate`

- Like in step 4, use an if statement (or a ternary operator) to determine the existence of `req.query.experience` and then use .filter to get the skills that match the criteria.

###### `POST /skills`
- Add a skill to the collection of skills. For this endpoint we need to create a function that will dynamically create IDs for us based on the length of our skills array. For example: 
```let id = skills.length + 1```


#### Step 7 (Black Diamond): Allow for more queries/params
* Let users search your hobbies, occupations, and skills endpoints by name.
* Try to use `req.params` and `req.query` at least once each.
* Update (`PUT`) a family member and restaurant.
